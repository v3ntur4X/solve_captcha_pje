# Solve Captcha PJE

This project is an implementation of the article ["Neural Network from scratch in Python"](https://towardsdatascience.com/math-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-d6da9f29ce65)


> Attention: this project saves the generated models in pickle format, so keep in mind that it may be executing malicious code lol (I'm thinking of another way to save the model)

## How to install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/v3ntur4X/solve_captcha_pje.git
cd solve_captcha_pje/
python -m pip install .
```

## How to run the tests
```bash
cd solve_captcha_pje/
python tests.py
```

### To-do:
- [ ] Function to predict an image
- [ ] Implement another way to save the generated model
